            <p>Would recommend but not with five stars. Props that the female protagonist is the one wearing a hawaiian shirt working the dead beat job (instead of the Seth-Rogan-like male protagonist). And props that the film addresses the concept of eccentric women being "too much" by humanizing the comedic bestfriend character. Even by adopting the strategy of swapping gender roles, the film feels almost culturally irrelevant based on how far the feminist movement has come since the film's release in 2018. (Thematic spoiler) The main take away of the story seems to be that the protagonist turns out to be resourceful and cunning, defying her mysoginistic, sleezy boyfriend's expectations. "Did you leave the flashdrive at my apartment because you thought I would never leave?" We know you're kick ass Mila Kunis, we've all seen you reem out the reporter on Justin Timberlake's behalf. That being said, Kate McKinnon's comedy elicits authentic laughs around every corner.</p>
