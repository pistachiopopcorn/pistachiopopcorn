            <p>A movie that so clearly illustrates the not-entirely-honest place, deep inside, where our desire to be "just friends" with the opposite sex comes from. It's filmed in a similar style to When Harry Met Sally (1989) as opposed to more sexualized films that've explored the concept in the last few decades. Miraculously, the film's screenplay doesn't shame the male or female protagonists - even when Radcliffe is standing in front of Hazan completely naked, his privates covered with but a strategically held collection of branches after skinny dipping gone awry. The audience watches the painfully long process of both protagonists coming to terms with their feelings for the other. These feelings unfurl - with the help of Adam Driver and Mackenzie Davis' absurdism - over months. Daniel Radcliffe does such a great job of depicting the good (somewhat pathetic) guy and Zoe Hazan, the provocative (somewhat pathetic) girl - particularly in the changeroom scene - that the audience can't help but nod slowly while at the edge of their seats. The cinematography is really creative in how it depicts timelines and secret thoughts, sometimes using subtle animation. With good acting and a simple but strong storyline, this movie returns 21st century cinema to a more classic time.</p>
