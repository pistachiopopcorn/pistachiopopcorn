            <p>Would recommend but maybe not with five stars. In terms of balancing out the variety of spy movies out there, the movie deserves props that its protagonists are female, where Mila Kunis is the one wearing the hawaiian shirt and working the dead beat job (instead of the Seth-Rogan-like male protagonist). And additional props that it addresses the trope of women being "too much" (by humanizing the comedic bestfriend character played by Kate McKinnon). But such strategies almost feel behind the times in cinema today. The movie was released in 2018 and the feminist movement has come a long way since then. The writer's could have come up with a more original approach then: the protagonist is actually resourceful and cunning, in the end she defies her mysoginistic, sleezy boyfriend's expectations. "Did you leave the flashdrive at my apartment because you thought I would never leave?" In addition, it's a bit harder to buy because we KNOW Mila Kunis is a badass! We've all seen her reem out the reporter on Justin Timberlake's behalf. At the very least, Kate McKinnon's comedy elicits authentic laughs around every corner.</p>
