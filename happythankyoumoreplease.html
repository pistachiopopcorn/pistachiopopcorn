            <p>Now that's what I'm talking about! This movie realistically highlights the modern, straight, cis-gendered, heterosexual, female experience living the big city. Perhaps its most powerful moment was when one female protagonist is encouraged to shut her eyes and let go, truly let go, and how powerful this might be in aiding one to unlearn decades of instilled superficiality (How many of us have whined "Why do I get the ugly one?" Outloud or inwardly when observing real, live people who we may feel compelled to date). The movie coaxes out our promise to try closing our eyes and letting go the next time we find ourselves challenged in receiving love. Overall, it's like Josh Radner wrote a movie based on snippets of eavesdropped late night strolls in the city and over work cubicle walls. That being said, some of the dialogue (especially the million dollar words Zoe Kazan uses) don't necessarily roll off the tongue, but they can be expected from a liberal-arts-grad, late-twenty-something in the big city. Look out for that authentic reaction, "You're my bestfriend in the whole WORLD". And my favourite line: "Whisper it to me." I'd challenge you to find a more intimate yet pure moment in cinema.</p>
