            <p>A brilliant critique of policing culture in New England, America. Far ahead of his time, Rogan captures the often-overlooked liberties taken by blue lives and how those influence impressionable youth. On youth: with only a few lines, a scoff, and blunt bangs that thickly and completely cover a single, Emma Stone is a believable portrait of The Highschool Girl. However her styling befits more the year the movie was filmed (2007) then the year within which it was set (1980). Her hair is simply too unteased and her eyeliner too not-electric-blue. Where the movie lags is establishing equality for all bodily fluid emissions; while the protagonists find periods gross, they find jizzing to be disgusting yet meh. This omission allows Big Mouth to stagger crowds 13 years later with stunning claims that all teenagers are equally emitting of gross fluids, always. Moving on. For an interesting comparative of the male versus female senior-North-American-high-school experience, we recommend watching Superbad back to back with Booksmart.</p>
