            <p>It doesn't take a genius to crack that this movie (like most of Seth Rogan's movies) is a phase of his life playing out on the big screen. The main character's name is Seth and Rogan himself plays a cop in the movie, probably unable to let his adolescent self (played by Jonah Hill) have all the fun. The movie features Rogan's characteristic hands-off writing style, leading to his idea of life-like, bumbling conversations. It's undeniable that the movie is a cult classic ("MCLOVIN!": a memory being shouted about in all corners of highschool hallways in 2007 when the movie came out). Unfortunately, it's pretty homophobic and brings up a bazillion phobias to do with anything female that can't be properly balanced by Michael Cera's minor Egoism ("Don't talk about her like that, man," he stutters quietly but Jonah Hill is already on his next line). That being said, Superbad's themes of brotherhood and Fogell's hilarity are engaging. Too bad the film completely misses out on all of the potential for inclusive adolescent exploration - sexual and otherwise - that Big Mouth capitalizes on 13 years later. For an interesting exercise, watch Superbad back to back with Booksmart. Both films feature two same-sex, North American protagonists coping with their final year of highschool; the parallels are uncanny but how they handle porn, sex, rebellion, highschool cuties, and class are so clearly different.</p>
